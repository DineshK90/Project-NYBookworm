        <h2>A Message From The Creators</h2>
        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>In a world where our daily lives is dominated by screens and  a constant information stream consisting(both good and bad), we thought of reminding everyone that there is another source of information and escapism. "A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading." </p>

        <p>One of the biggest problems most bookworms encounter is keeping track of books we are reading, recalling books we already read and as well as recalling what we learnt from the book. After all, As Charles W. Elliot says, Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers."</p>

        <p>We aim to change this with this App. In this app, you will find a guide or a sort of bookmark to aide you in your journey in reading. Keep track of books you are currently reading. Tick off the books that you finished. Find inspiration on what book to read next. Most importantly, keep track of what you learnt from a particular book. This will be the last book tracking app you will ever need.</p>

        <p>"Thatâ€™s the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet"</p>
